Digger was originally created by Windmill software in 1983 and released as a copy-protected, bootable 5.25" floppy disk for the IBM PC. As it requires a genuine CGA card, it didn't work on modern PCs.

In 1998, Andrew Jenner created Digger Remastered, which runs on all PCs with CGA or better and plays just like the original.
The Unix version is by Maxim Sobolev.

Dingoo version by djdron ;-)
